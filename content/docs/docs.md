Municipal Services in India
===========================


Challenges
----------

India is rapidly urbanizing and it is seeing an increase not only in population but also living standards. These factors are resulting in increased demand for urban services such as safe and reliable water supply and prompt removal of waste water and solid waste. However, these services rely upon increasingly scarce natural resources - fresh water supply sources and water bodies and land to safely absorb and break down waste.

Because of the haphazard development and unplanned urbanization, Indian municipalities not only provide inadequate services but the services are grossly inquitable. Poor neighborhoods and slums either do not have municipal infrastructure servicing them or see large disruptions in service.
   
Municipalities do have well-intentioned folks doing their best with the resources at hand and deal with challenges such as political interference, poverty (and inability to pay for services), aging infrastructure, frequent discontinuties in leadership, lack of environmental and social education, etc.  
 
However, each municipality faces specific challenges which SmartTerra intends to help solve:
- Lack of operational visibility: There is very little data collected and most of the data is usually not digital. As an example, the GIS description of hundreds of KMs of water pipeline network is usually offline in small cities which means that field workers mostly dig first to search for pipes. 
- Ad-hoc resource management: Most municipalities have a large workforce but task management and task co-ordination is mostly offline and verbal. There also is a lack of automation, solicitation of feedback and very little knowledge transfer of best practices. 
- Reactive maintenance: 
- No support for innovation:

Municipalities services such as water supply, waste water removal, solid waste removal, etc are delivered to a geographically distributed population.
