Municipal Services in India
===========================


Challenges
----------

India is rapidly urbanizing and it is seeing an increase not only in population but also living standards. These factors are resulting in increased demand for urban services such as safe and reliable water supply and prompt removal of waste water and solid waste. However, these services rely upon increasingly scarce natural resources - fresh water supply sources and water bodies and land to safely absorb and break down waste.

Because of the haphazard development and unplanned urbanization, Indian municipalities not only provide inadequate services but the services are grossly inquitable. Poor neighborhoods and slums either do not have municipal infrastructure servicing them or see large disruptions in service.
   
Municipalities do have well-intentioned folks doing their best with the resources at hand and deal with challenges such as political interference, poverty (and inability to pay for services), aging infrastructure, frequent discontinuties in leadership, lack of environmental and social education, etc.  
 
However, each municipality faces specific challenges which SmartTerra intends to help solve:

- Lack of operational visibility: There is very little data collected and most of the data is usually not digital. As an example, the GIS description of hundreds of KMs of water pipeline network is usually offline in small cities which means that field workers mostly dig first to search for pipes. 
- Ad-hoc resource management: Most municipalities have a large workforce but task management and task co-ordination is mostly offline and verbal. There also is a lack of automation, solicitation of feedback and very little knowledge transfer of best practices. 
- Reactive maintenance: 
- No support for innovation:

Municipalities services such as water supply, waste water removal, solid waste removal, etc are delivered to a geographically distributed population.

Example Cities

In the following sections we will discuss some details of the water supply situation in Kakinada, Hyderabad and Nagpur. 


### Hyderabad

### Kakinada

Lets take a look at how Kakinada, a city of about 3.5 lakhs in Andhra Pradesh, handles its water supply.

Kakinada's main source of raw water is the Godavari Canal through summer storage tanks. The present water supply is 45 MLD with a per capita supply of 107LPCD. NRW was 35% in 2015 and is expected to be reduced to 20% in 2016 because of the network renewal as part of the APMDP scheme. 

Kakinada's Smart City applications can be found at these links - [SCP](https://www.dropbox.com/s/a5i50ym7rhjxkaa/kakinadaSCP.pdf?dl=0) and [Annexure](https://www.dropbox.com/s/7r4pdr9vkxic0xz/KakinadaAnnexures.pdf?dl=0).

**Existing Network**

Kakinada has approx. 60,000 households in 50 wards. The municipality has 1200 borewells and two summer/intermediate storage tanks at Aratlakatta (1582ML capacity) and Sambamurthy (821ML capacity) both of which are fed from the Godavari/Kakinada canal, an open-surface source. 

There are 9 pump stations with each containing 2-4 pumps each of 60-240HP capacity. There is a diesel generator available at each of the pump stations.

Water is pumped from the storage tanks into sumps and elevated storage reservoirs.

There are 4 tankers of 10,000L capacity with the municipality and 6-8 private tankers which are outsourced by the municipality or are filled by the municipality. On a given summer day of May 5th 2016, there were 21 trips carrying a total of .11MLD made by the 4 municipal tankers, 58 trips carrying a total of .44MLD made by 6 private tankers. 

**Processes**

The municipality tracks the amount of water in the summer storage tanks on a daily basis. It tracks a key metric - sustainabilty. The Telangana government and the Andhra government track the cities' water situation in the publicly available[TS PHMED](http://www.tspublichealth.gov.in/dailyStatusReport.do) and  [AP PHMED](http://www.appublichealth.gov.in/dailyStatusReport.do) websites.  
These websites contain the details for sustainability periods, deficit reports, statuses of pipelines, borewells, etc.

The Kakinada municipality enters a daily summary into the [Urban Water Supply](http://uwsis.cgg.gov.in) website which is then aggregated over all the cities into the AP PHMED website mentioned above.
